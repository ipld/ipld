# Tendermint Chain Data Structures

## Tendermint Block
A block consists of a header, transactions, votes (the commit), and a list of evidence of malfeasance (i.e. signing conflicting votes).
Blocks are indirectly content-hash referenced by the root of a Merkle tree composed of its parts.
```ipldsch
# BlockCID is a CID link to the root node of a Part merkle tree (all of the parts of a complete block)
# This CID is composed of the SHA_256 multihash of the root node in the Part merkle tree and the Block codec (tbd)
# Part merkle tree is a Merkle tree built from the PartSet, each leafs contains Part.Bytes
type BlockCID &MerkleTreeNode

# Block defines the atomic unit of a Tendermint blockchain
type Block struct {
	Header Header
	Data Txs
	Evidence EvidenceList
	LastCommit Commit
}

# BlockID contains two distinct Merkle roots of the block.
type BlockID struct {
	Hash          HeaderCID
	PartSetHeader PartSetHeader
}

# PartSetHeader is used for secure gossiping of the block during consensus
# It contains the Merkle root of the complete serialized block cut into parts (ie. MerkleRoot(MakeParts(block))).
type PartSetHeader struct {
	Total Uint
	Hash  BlockCID
}

# PartSet is the complete set of parts for a header
type PartSet [Part]

# Part is a section of bytes of a complete protobuf serialized block
type Part struct {
	Index Uint
	Bytes HexBytes
	Proof Proof
}
```

## Light Block
LightBlock is the core data structure of the light client.
It combines two data structures needed for verification (SignedHeader & ValidatorSet).
CID links to LightBlock use the SHA256 multihash and the LightBlock codec (tbd).
```ipldsch
# LightBlock is a SignedHeader and a ValidatorSet.
# It is the basis of the light client
type LightBlock struct {
	SignedHeader SignedHeader
	ValidatorSet  ValidatorSet
}

# SignedHeader is a header along with the commits that prove it.
type SignedHeader struct {
	Header Header
	Commit Commit
}
```

## Tendermint Merkle Node
A Merkle tree node is a single node in a Merkle tree. A Merkle node is referenced by its hash.
The top-level node in the tree is the root node, its hash is the Merkle root. Tendermint uses
the RFC 6962 specification of a merkle tree, with sha256 as the hash function.
* The hash of an inner node is `SHA_256(0x01 || left_hash || right_hash)`.
* The hash of a leaf node is `SHA_256(0x00 || value)`.
* The multicodec type used for a Merkle tree will depend on the content it stores
```ipldsch
type MerkleTreeNode union {
    | MerkleTreeRootNode "root"
    | MerkleTreeInnerNode "inner"
    | MerkleTreeLeafNode "leaf"
} representation keyed

# MerkleTreeRootNode is the top-most node in a merkle tree; the root node of the tree.
# It can be a leaf node if there is only one value in the tree
# We explicitly type the root node for the purposes of handling Block and Header marshalling
# since entire sub-dags need to be collapsed down and encoded into the protobuf object we need to be
# able to check that the ipld.Node provided to the marshaller is a root node
type MerkleTreeRootNode MerkleTreeNode

# MerkleTreeInnerNode nodes contain two byte arrays which contain the hashes which link its two child nodes.
type MerkleTreeInnerNode struct {
    Left nullable &MerkleTreeNode
    Right nullable &MerkleTreeNode
}

# Value union type used to handle the different values stored in leaf nodes in the different merkle trees
type Value union {
    | SimpleValidator "validator"
    | Evidence "evidence"
    | TxCID "tx"
    | Part "part"
    | ResponseDeliverTx "result"
    | Bytes "header"
    | CommitSig "commit"
} representation keyed

# MerkleTreeLeafNode is a single byte array containing the value stored at that leaf
# Often times this "value" will be a hash of content rather than the content itself
type MerkleTreeLeafNode struct {
    Value Value
}
```

## Tendermint Header
A block header contains metadata about the block and about the consensus, as well as commitments to the data in the current block,
the previous block, and the results returned by the application.
Similar to blocks, headers are indirectly content-hash referenced by the root of a Merkle tree composed of its separate fields.
```ipldsch
# HeaderCID is a CID link to the root node of a Header merkle tree
# This CID is composed of the SHA_256 multihash of the root node in the Header merkle tree and the Header codec (tbd)
# Header merkle tree is a Merklization of all of the fields in the header
type HeaderCID &MerkleTreeNode

# Header defines the structure of a Tendermint block header
type Header struct {
	# basic block info
	Version Version
	ChainID String
	Height  Int
	Time    Time

	# prev block info
	# the first block has an empty BlockID struct as LastBlockID
	LastBlockID BlockID

	# hashes of block data
	LastCommitHash CommitTreeCID # MerkleRoot of the current Signatures
	DataHash       TxTreeCID # MerkleRoot of the current Txs

	# hashes from the app output from the prev block
	ValidatorsHash     ValidatorTreeCID # MerkleRoot of the current validator set
	NextValidatorsHash ValidatorTreeCID # MerkleRoot of the next validator set
	ConsensusHash      HashedParamsCID # SHA256 hash of HashedParams
	AppHash            AppStateTreeCID # State Root from the state machine

	# root hash of all results from the txs from the previous block
	LastResultsHash ResultTreeCID # MerkleRoot of the last blocks Result set

	# consensus info
	EvidenceHash    EvidenceTreeCID # MerkleRoot of the current Evidence set
	ProposerAddress Address
}
```

## Tendermint Params
```ipldsch
# HashedParamsCID is a CID link to the HashedParams for this Header
# This CID is composed of the SHA_256 multihash of the linked protobuf encoded HashedParams struct and the Params codec (tbd)
type HashParamsCID &HashedParams

# HashedParams is a subset of ConsensusParams that is included in the consensus encoding
# It is hashed into the Header.ConsensusHash
type HashedParams struct {
	BlockMaxBytes Int
	BlockMaxGas   Int
}
```

## Tendermint Result
```ipldsch
# ResultTreeCID is a CID link to the root node of a Result merkle tree
# This CID is composed of the SHA_256 multihash of the root node in a Result merkle tree and the ResultTree codec (tbd)
# Result merkle tree is a Merkle tree built from ResponseDeliverTx responses (Log, Info, Codespace and Events fields are ignored)
type ResultTreeCID &MerkleTreeNode

# ResponseDeliverTx are the consensus fields of an ABCI ResponseDeliverTx, that are included in the ResultTree
type ResponseDeliverTx struct {
    Code      Uint
    Data      Bytes
    GasWanted Int
    GasUsed   Int
}
```

## Tendermint Transaction
```ipldsch
# TxTreeCID is a CID link to the root node of a Tx merkle tree
# This CID is composed of the SHA_256 multihash of the root node in the Tx merkle tree and the TxTree codec (tbd)
# Tx merkle tree is a Merkle tree built from the set of Txs at the given block
# Note: The transactions are hashed before being included in the Merkle tree, the leaves of the Merkle tree are the hashes, not the transactions themselves.
type TxTreeCID &MerkleTreeNode

#Txs is a list of Tx.
type Txs [Tx]

# TxCID is a link to a TX
# TxCID uses the SHA256 multihash and the Raw codec (0x55)
type TxCID &Tx

# Tx is an arbitrary byte array.
# Tx has no types at the Tendermint level, instead it encodes arbitrary length-prefixed data that can be decoded and processed in a state-machine specific manner.
type Tx [Bytes]
```

## Tendermint Commit
```ipldsch
# CommitTreeCID is a CID link to the root node of a Commit merkle tree
# This CID is composed of the SHA_256 multihash of the root node in a Commit merkle tree and the CommitTree codec (tbd)

type CommitTreeCID &MerkleTreeNode

# Commit contains the evidence that a block was committed by a set of validators
NOTE: Commit is empty for height 1, but never nil.
type Commit struct {
	# NOTE: The signatures are in order of address to preserve the bonded
	# ValidatorSet order.
	# Any peer with a block can gossip signatures by index with a peer without
	# recalculating the active ValidatorSet.

```
# A Proposal IPLD block contains the varint-delimited protobuf encoding of a CanonicalProposal
# ProposalCID is a link to a Proposal
# ProposalCID uses the SHA256 multihash and the Proposal codec (tbd)
type ProposalCID &Proposal

# Proposal defines a block proposal for the consensus.
# It refers to the block by BlockID field.
# It must be signed by the correct proposer for the given Height/Round
# to be considered valid. It may depend on votes from a previous round,
# a so-called Proof-of-Lock (POL) round, as noted in the POLRound.
# If POLRound >= 0, then BlockID corresponds to the block that is locked in POLRound.
type Proposal struct {
	Type      SignedMsgType

#
# The validators can be fetched by address or index.
# The index is in order of .VotingPower, so the indices are fixed for all

type ValidatorSet struct {
	Validators Validators
	Proposer   Validator
}
