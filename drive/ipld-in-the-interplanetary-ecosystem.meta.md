Meta: IPLD in the Interplanetary Ecosystem
==========================================

This document is meant to answer very basic, high-level questions about how the different Interplanetary projects are related.

It should be readable in minutes (and skimmable in less).
After reading it, someone should be able to clearly conceptualize the relationship between IPFS, IPLD, and libp2p.

We might expect to link to this document as one of the first primers for anyone who's heard of IPFS, but isn't yet clear on what IPLD is.
(This is a common path right now, and we need a document that handles this quickly and concisely.)


Review wishlist
---------------

### detail check

Currently, some details are included (like "what is bitswap") which may be too fine-grained;
we could either consider moving those elsewhere,
or simply accept that the bottom half of this document is not going to be at the appropriate level of detail for many readers coming to it for high-level introduction.

### more external references to content addressing

I'm not super happy with the links to content addressing background information.  Better material to link to would be welcome.

In particular, I'd like to get a high-level semantic primer -- *just* focusing on content-addressing as a *concept* -- and not introducing CIDs concretely (yet).
(It's a lot easier to explain CIDs, and the various forms of future-proofing they encapsulate, if the relevance of hashing is already thoroughly understood.)

I guess this is central enough we should also just write our own documentation focusing on this.
