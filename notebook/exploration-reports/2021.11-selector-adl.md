# Signalling ADLs in selectors

This is a reflection on the plan for signalling ADLs in selectors that was merged in PR 149 to this repository.

A primary consideration was how the ADL should be signalled. In the longer term, the hope is that an ADL can be identified by a CID. In particular, this CID would be the pointer to the data of the code (perhaps wasm) implementation of the ADL that should be employed. There are a few remaining pieces not yet implemented to reach this being a meaningful or implementable signalling mechanism at this point.

In the interim, we were faced with two options: we can encode well-known ADLs in the multicodec table and use the multicodec identifiers from that table as the IDs for signalling an ADL, or we can use string representations (like "unixfs" or "hamtv3") to signal ADLs, and agree upon it in an implementation-dependent set of conventions.

While there's a desire to ensure that selectors are consistent, and so a selector indicating an ADL that the other side of the network protocol doesn't recognize fails fast, it was also deemed plausible that in this case the signalling is closer to how multi-streams are identified (byt string identifier) than other multicodecs. At this phase, we want to be able to agree on local conventions for signalling without needing to register in the global table each time. Use of string identifiers is therefore the current spec.
