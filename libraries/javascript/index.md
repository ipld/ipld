JavaScript IPLD Libraries
=========================

### js-multiformats
[multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats) is the primary entry point to the IPLD world for JavaScript. This library defines common interfaces and low level building blocks for various interrelated multiformat technologies (multicodec, multihash, multibase, and CID). They can be used to implement custom base encoders / decoders / codecs, codec encoders / decoders and multihash hashers that comply to the interface that layers above assume.

See the [multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats) library for more examples and further documentation.
