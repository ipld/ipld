# Build workflow - runs for both PRs and main branch pushes
# This workflow builds the website without access to secrets
# For PRs: Runs on untrusted fork code safely (using pull_request event, not pull_request_target)
# For main: Builds and uploads artifacts for deployment
# Artifacts are passed to the deploy workflow which has access to secrets
