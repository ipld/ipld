Finding Community
=================

IPLD is an Open Source project and we welcome contributions of all sorts.
There are many ways to help, from reporting issues, contributing code, and
helping us improve our community.

### Chat

- For chats with the developers and the community: Join us in any of these (bridged) locations:
	- On Discord: join the [IPLD community on IPFS Discord](https://discord.gg/xkUC8bqSCP).
	- On Matrix: [#ipld:ipfs.io](https://matrix.to/#/#ipld:ipfs.io)
	- On IRC: (bridge coming soon) (note that we no longer use the freenode network!)

### Development

- On Github:
	- Check out all our repos in the https://github.com/ipld/ organization.
	- Github issues can be used for discussing designs, documenting user needs, and submitting bug reports.
	- Git patches and Github pull requests are welcome!  (Although discussing changes via issues or one of the chat venues above first is highly recommended.)

### Code of Conduct

The IPLD project has a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) (which is shared with the IPFS project).
Collaborators, contributors, and any participants in community spaces are expected to be able to abide by this code.
