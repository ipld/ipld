Python IPLD Libraries
=====================

Unless otherwise noted, all of these are installable with pip from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

### hashberg
[Hashberg](https://www.hashberg.io/) has a complete IPLD implementation in its [multiformats](https://github.com/hashberg-io/multiformats/) library ([docs](https://multiformats.readthedocs.io/)), along with a [dag-cbor](https://github.com/hashberg-io/dag-cbor/) library ([docs](https://dag-cbor.readthedocs.io/)).

### dag-json
The [dag-json](https://github.com/snarfed/dag-json) library integrates with Hashberg's [`multiformats.CID`](https://multiformats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cid.html) and passes all of the [DAG-JSON cross-codec test fixtures](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-json/fixtures/cross-codec/).
