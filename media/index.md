This high level talk discusses what IPLD is, what the motivations are,
how IPFS and IPLD are related,
and introduces thinking about decentralized data structures made possible by hash-based linking.
It's part of a larger series published by the Resilient Networks Lab about the "InterPlanetary" technologies.

## Foundations for Decentralization: Data with IPLD @ GPN19

<iframe width="512" height="288" src="https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn19-105-foundations-for-decentralization-data-with-ipld/oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This talk introduces IPLD and is targeted at giving newcomers a rapid overview, from the top to bottom of the system.
Our dream of decentralized software is introduced, how we use content-addressing and immutable linking to get there,
what the IPLD [Data Model](/docs/data-model/) is about, how we use [Advanced Layouts](/docs/advanced-data-layouts/) to handle big data,
and even how we use IPLD [Schemas](/docs/schemas/) as a decentralized-development-friendly way to describe protocol evolution.
