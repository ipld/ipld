ADL Naming
==========

:::todo
- This page should cover how ADLs are identified.
- tl;dr:
  - strings are used.
    - hopefully these are descriptive of the algorithm.
	- (multicodecs or other numerical indicators are not used, because legibility matters more than compactness.)
	- (CIDs are not used, because there's no single interpreter of a single canonical bytecode, etc -- would presume jumping straight to the dynamic loading problem, which is too many jumps at once.)
  - this is currently convention-heavy and a young field; we do not yet maintain recommendations nor a table of well-known values.
  - naming and signalling are separate problems with separate solutions.  (The solutions interact, but don't confuse the problems.)
