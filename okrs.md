# Quarterly Objectives and Key Results

We try to frame our ongoing work using a process based on quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Objectives reflect outcomes that are challenging, but realistic. Results are tangible and measurable.

## 2018 Q2

> Work in Progress

### Implement updated IPLD Format spec

 - Finish updating the IPLD format spec
 - Have proper JSON serialization for JavaScript formats (Bitcoin, CBOR, DAG-PB, Ethereum, Git, Zcash)
 - Have proper JSON serialization for Go formats (Bitcoin, CBOR, DAG-PB, Ethereum, Git, Zcash)
 - Implement the rest of the missing pieces of the spec in JavaScript
 - Implement the rest of the missing pieces of the spec in Go

### Search on IPLD

 - Capturing three use cases and examples in a document
 - Do a prototype with Noise supporting those use cases

### Design and implement GraphSync, to improve performance of Apps

 - Have benchmarks that demonstrate GraphSync perf improvement over original Bitswap (in js and go)
 - The GraphSync protocol has a designdoc that captures all constraints
 - The GraphSync protocol has a v0 spec
 - The GraphSync protocol has a v0 implementation in js
 - The GraphSync protocol has a v0 implementation in go
 - GraphSync learns to distribute IPLD paths
 - GraphSync learns to distribute IPLD paths with wildcards (basic wildcard selectors)
 - GraphSync learns to distribute IPLD Selectors (full)
